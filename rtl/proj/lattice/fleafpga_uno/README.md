# FleaFPGA Uno projects

    FleaFPGA_Uno_bram_sram8

Original project by Xark from FleaFPGA team
with specifically developed vendor specific support
for all onboard hardware, but uses old/obsolete glue.
Project is currently slightly broken, needs a bit of 
rework to follow some core changes)

    xram_sram8

Emard's adaptation for new glue_xram which be universal
for all board, ranging from minimal bram-only configuration
to full-feature board support with external RAM and all
onboard hardware. Currently FleaFPGA 8-bit SRAM seems to
work and HDMI support might be soon there.
